# Face-Mask-Detection-Image-Processing
In the pursuit of enhancing public health and safety, we present our cutting-edge project on Face Mask Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Leveraging advanced image processing techniques and a meticulously curated dataset, our goal is to accurately identify individuals wearing masks and those without masks in real-world scenarios.
