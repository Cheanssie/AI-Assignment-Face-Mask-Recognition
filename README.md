# Face-Mask-Detection-Image-Processing
In the pursuit of enhancing public health and safety, we present our cutting-edge project on Face Mask Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Leveraging advanced image processing techniques and a meticulously curated dataset, our goal is to accurately identify individuals wearing masks and those without masks in real-world scenarios.

## Dataset and Data Curation:
Our dataset is carefully sourced from the renowned "pyimagesearch" online platform, a reputable resource for computer vision and image processing. Comprising 3,832 images, it includes diverse representations of individuals wearing masks [with_mask] and those not wearing masks [without_mask]. The dataset is thoughtfully balanced, ensuring an equal distribution of both categories, and encompasses images in JPG, JPEG, and PNG formats

## Methodology:

### 1. Preprocessing and Augmentation: 
The dataset undergoes preprocessing and augmentation to ensure uniformity and prevent overfitting. Techniques like resizing, normalization, and data augmentation are applied to enhance model generalization.

### 2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): 
Our model architecture revolves around a powerful CNN, designed to extract relevant features from the input images. This deep learning approach enables the model to discern intricate patterns and relationships for accurate classification.

### 3. Training and Validation: 
The CNN is trained on the curated dataset, and hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize model performance. Validation techniques such as cross-validation aid in evaluating the model's accuracy and identifying potential areas for improvement.
